## Introduction

PHPBrowserBox is an open source project founded by Anthony Ogundipe in the year 2013 to provide a way for developing native desktop GUI applications using web technologies such as PHP, HTML5, JavaScript, MySQL, SQLite and Google Chrome.

It is a convenient tool for converting PHP web apps and PHP CLI tools to desktop applications with little effort.


In a certain sense phpbrowserbox acts differently from a PHP to EXE compiler. It embeds a web browser, a multi-threaded web server and a PHP interpreter.
All embedded into a single application, a portable folder that you can easily distribute to end users by packing it to zip archive or by making an [installer for your application](../../wiki/Knowledge-Base#application-installer).


Technically all php versions are supported, but official support is php 7.3 and above.
All popular PHP frameworks are supported, see the [PHP frameworks support](../../wiki/PHP-frameworks-support) wiki page.

You can create a standalone executable for distribution with the help of the [Inno Setup installer](../../wiki/Knowledge-Base#application-installer).
PHP sources can be protected with other [useful tools](../../wiki/Knowledge-Base#useful-tools).

PHPBrowserBox is released under non-restrictive license, thus it is [free for commercial use](../../wiki/Knowledge-Base#can-i-use-php-desktop-in-a-commercial-closed-sourced-project).

Lots of other useful information can be found on the
[Knowledge Base](../../wiki/Knowledge-Base) wiki page and on the
[PHPBrowserBox Website](https://phpbrowserbox.com).
